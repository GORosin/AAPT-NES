<p>Responsibilities include supervising the executive board meetings at the fall and spring section meetings and the summer executive board meeting as well as constructing an agenda for each meeting and choosing the site for the summer meeting; working on long-term section issues; assisting the program chair with running the section meetings; soliciting candidates for Vice President and other vacant offices and organizing the selection process for the Janet Guernsey award.</p>

<p><strong><u>Vice President:</u></strong></p>
<p>Responsibilities include assisting the President-Elect in planning, organizing and running the upcoming spring meeting.

<p><strong><u>Recording Secretary:</u></strong></p>
