In fact, women make up only 20 % of recipients of bachelor’s degrees in physics.  The good news is that high school teachers can strongly influence women to pursue a degree in physics.  The STEP UP project has developed research-based lessons to engage women in this discipline and has created a nationwide community of teachers committed to increasing the representation of women in physics.  We will be presenting one of the lesson plans entitled “Careers in Physics” which may be successfully taught remotely, in person, or in a hybrid classroom situation.  These lessons will help your students assess their personal values in relation to a career in physics, examine profiles of professionals with a physics degree, and envision themselves in a physics career.  In addition, some of the student misconceptions surrounding the relevance of physics to other fields of study as well as its pivotal role in solving many societal problems such as climate change and curing cancer will be addressed.</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</UncontrolledCollapse>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div className=\"section\">\r\n\t\t\t<h2 id=\"sep21\"><Badge color=\"danger\">Sep 21st</Badge> Fall 2020 Meeting of NES-AAPT<Button color=\"primary\">Details</Button></h2>\r\n\t\t\t<UncontrolledCollapse toggler=\"#sep21\">\r\n\t\t\t<hr/>\r\n\t\t\t<p>On behalf of the board of the AAPT-New England Section, we wish to announce the 2020 Fall Meeting to be held remotely (via Zoom) on Saturday, October 31, 2020. 10:00 am to 2:00 pm; workshop(s) from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The meeting theme is Improving Physics Instructional Lab Experiences.

In fact, women make up only 20 % of recipients of bachelor’s degrees in physics.  The good news is that high school teachers can strongly influence women to pursue a degree in physics.  The STEP UP project has developed research-based lessons to engage women in this discipline and has created a nationwide community of teachers committed to increasing the representation of women in physics.  We will be presenting one of the lesson plans entitled “Careers in Physics” which may be successfully taught remotely, in person, or in a hybrid classroom situation.  These lessons will help your students assess their personal values in relation to a career in physics, examine profiles of professionals with a physics degree, and envision themselves in a physics career.  In addition, some of the student misconceptions surrounding the relevance of physics to other fields of study as well as its pivotal role in solving many societal problems such as climate change and curing cancer will be addressed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n       </div>\r\n       </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default About;","import React from 'react';\r\n \r\nconst About = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\n       <div className=\"section\">\r\n          <h2>Physics Olympics</h2>\r\n\t\t  <hr/>\r\n          <p>\r\n\t\t 32nd Annual Eastern Massachusetts Physics Olympics is coming<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSaturday April 11th, 2020<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThayer Academy<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“It’s Physics Phun for Everyone!”<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n8:00 AM to 2:00 PM<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDirections to Thayer Academy<br/><br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Build-Ahead Events:</b><br/><br/>\r\n<b>“Practice-Ahead Events”</b>: Physics Bowl 1 (paper and pencil physics trivia, fermi questions, measurements), Physics Bowl 2 (quiz bowl buzz in type event)<br/><br/>\r\n<b>“Surprise Events”</b><br/><br/>\r\n<b>A fee, $TBD per school</b>, will cover the cost of three pizzas per school, drinks and trophies.

But it predicts only the possible results and the probability of obtaining each result. Results and probabilities. That’s all there are! The ultimate question is, “Is this all there is to know about the quantum experiment?” Bohr answers, “Yes. If we know the results and the probability of occurrence for each result, then we know everything there is to know about that experiment. There is nothing else!””Not so,” says Einstein. “Surely, there must be more to an experiment than just results and probabilities. Obviously, quantum mechanics does not tell us the whole story.”Bell’s theorem says they cannot both be correct. There can be no quantum mechanics that embraces the tenets of classical physics. Nature has to choose one or the other. We answer the question by taking the reader from classical physics through Bell’s theorem in the context of the Bohr-Einstein debate over the meaning of reality. The classical approach of Einstein is pitted against the quantum mechanics of Bohr, common sense against the counterintuitive nature of the new theory. Entanglement is the essential characteristic of quantum mechanics that makes it different from classical theory. And with entanglement there is no reality as we know it. In particular, we discuss the EPR experiment and Bell’s theorem in detail. At the end of it all, we are forced to conclude, as did Bell, that quantum mechanics is incompatible with classical physics. Subsequent experiments confirm that local realism, as professed in classical theory, is untenable.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t<h4>New book by David Morin: Lecturer on Physics, and Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Harvard University</h4>\r\n\t\t<h4><span className=\"new\">NEW!</span> Special Relativity – For the Enthusiastic Beginner (David Morin)</h4>\r\n\t\t<ul className =\"nopoints\">\r\n\t\t<li>Self-published (so that I could keep the price low) through CreateSpace, 2017,</li><li>250 pages.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Intended audience: College or advanced high school.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Buy online (Amazon) Temporarily 50% off – see below.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Paperback: $19.95</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Kindle eBook: $7.95 (or free if you buy the paperback from Amazon).

An individual is limited to two consecutive terms. The Section Representative serves as liaison between the section and the Association. Responsibilities include attending three meetings at the AAPT Annual Winter Meeting each year. The three meetings include the council and section representative meetings and the section officers’ exchange. Although funding for travel and lodging are available only for the Winter Meeting, the Section Representative is urged to also attend the AAPT Annual Summer Meeting. A one-page report to the board is required within a reasonable period after the end of each annual meeting attended. When unable to attend an Annual Meeting, a substitute should be found. Also, the Section Representative is to provide the Announcer, for each issue (four times a year), a summary of the activities of the section for the prior 3 months.</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>Webmaster:</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>The position is an appointive one and the Webmaster serves at the pleasure of the Board and for an indefinite term. Duties include maintaining and updating, as promptly as possible, the section webpage. Good, clear channels of communication between the webmaster and Board members are essential. The webmaster should constantly advise the Board on ways to upgrade the section’s offerings on the webpages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ARTICLE VII: <u>Representative to the Council of AAPT.</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>7.1     The Executive Board, from among those members who are active members of AAPT, shall appoint the New England Section Representative to the Council of AAPT.</p>\r\n<p>7.2     The Section Representative shall serve at the pleasure of the Executive Board.</p>\r\n<p>7.3     If the Section Representative cannot attend any meetings of the section representatives or Council, notice shall be given to the President, prior to such national AAPT meeting , who shall appoint an alternate NES-AAPT member of AAPT. If, in the opinion of the Executive Board, the Section Representative cannot show just cause for the absence, the Section Representative position will be declared vacant and a new Section Representative will be appointed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ARTICLE VIII: <u>Committees:</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>A. Janet Guernsey Award Committee</p>\r\n<p>8.1     The name of the award is the Janet Guernsey Award For Excellence In Teaching Physics</p>\r\n<p>8.2     The purpose of the award is to recognize a section member who has shown extraordinary commitment, creativity and leadership in the teaching of physics, and service to the profession. See By-Laws</p>\r\n<p>B. Nominating Committee</p>\r\n<p>The Nominating Committee is comprised of the Executive Board who, through the President, notifies the membership of an opening position (generally through the section webpage and/or email).
