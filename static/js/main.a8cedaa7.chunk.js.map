In fact, women make up only 20 % of recipients of bachelor’s degrees in physics.  The good news is that high school teachers can strongly influence women to pursue a degree in physics.  The STEP UP project has developed research-based lessons to engage women in this discipline and has created a nationwide community of teachers committed to increasing the representation of women in physics.  We will be presenting one of the lesson plans entitled “Careers in Physics” which may be successfully taught remotely, in person, or in a hybrid classroom situation.  These lessons will help your students assess their personal values in relation to a career in physics, examine profiles of professionals with a physics degree, and envision themselves in a physics career.  In addition, some of the student misconceptions surrounding the relevance of physics to other fields of study as well as its pivotal role in solving many societal problems such as climate change and curing cancer will be addressed.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</UncontrolledCollapse>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div className=\"section\">\n\t\t\t<h2 id=\"sep21\"><Badge color=\"danger\">Sep 21st</Badge> Fall 2020 Meeting of NES-AAPT<Button color=\"primary\">Details</Button></h2>\n\t\t\t<UncontrolledCollapse toggler=\"#sep21\">\n\t\t\t<hr/>\n\t\t\t<p>On behalf of the board of the AAPT-New England Section, we wish to announce the 2020 Fall Meeting to be held remotely (via Zoom) on Saturday, October 31, 2020. 10:00 am to 2:00 pm; workshop(s) from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The meeting theme is Improving Physics Instructional Lab Experiences.

In fact, women make up only 20 % of recipients of bachelor’s degrees in physics.  The good news is that high school teachers can strongly influence women to pursue a degree in physics.  The STEP UP project has developed research-based lessons to engage women in this discipline and has created a nationwide community of teachers committed to increasing the representation of women in physics.  We will be presenting one of the lesson plans entitled “Careers in Physics” which may be successfully taught remotely, in person, or in a hybrid classroom situation.  These lessons will help your students assess their personal values in relation to a career in physics, examine profiles of professionals with a physics degree, and envision themselves in a physics career.  In addition, some of the student misconceptions surrounding the relevance of physics to other fields of study as well as its pivotal role in solving many societal problems such as climate change and curing cancer will be addressed.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n       </div>\n       </div>\n    );\n}\n \nexport default About;","import React from 'react';\n \nconst About = () => {\n    return (\n\t\t\t<div>\n       <div className=\"section\">\n          <h2>Physics Olympics</h2>\n\t\t  <hr/>\n          <p>\n\t\t 32nd Annual Eastern Massachusetts Physics Olympics is coming<br/><br/>\n\nSaturday April 11th, 2020<br/><br/>\n\nThayer Academy<br/><br/>\n\n“It’s Physics Phun for Everyone!”<br/><br/>\n\n8:00 AM to 2:00 PM<br/><br/>\n\nDirections to Thayer Academy<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Build-Ahead Events:</b><br/><br/>\n<b>“Practice-Ahead Events”</b>: Physics Bowl 1 (paper and pencil physics trivia, fermi questions, measurements), Physics Bowl 2 (quiz bowl buzz in type event)<br/><br/>\n<b>“Surprise Events”</b><br/><br/>\n<b>A fee, $TBD per school</b>, will cover the cost of three pizzas per school, drinks and trophies.

But it predicts only the possible results and the probability of obtaining each result. Results and probabilities. That’s all there are! The ultimate question is, “Is this all there is to know about the quantum experiment?” Bohr answers, “Yes. If we know the results and the probability of occurrence for each result, then we know everything there is to know about that experiment. There is nothing else!””Not so,” says Einstein. “Surely, there must be more to an experiment than just results and probabilities. Obviously, quantum mechanics does not tell us the whole story.”Bell’s theorem says they cannot both be correct. There can be no quantum mechanics that embraces the tenets of classical physics. Nature has to choose one or the other. We answer the question by taking the reader from classical physics through Bell’s theorem in the context of the Bohr-Einstein debate over the meaning of reality. The classical approach of Einstein is pitted against the quantum mechanics of Bohr, common sense against the counterintuitive nature of the new theory. Entanglement is the essential characteristic of quantum mechanics that makes it different from classical theory. And with entanglement there is no reality as we know it. In particular, we discuss the EPR experiment and Bell’s theorem in detail. At the end of it all, we are forced to conclude, as did Bell, that quantum mechanics is incompatible with classical physics. Subsequent experiments confirm that local realism, as professed in classical theory, is untenable.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>New book by David Morin: Lecturer on Physics, and Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Harvard University</h4>\n\t\t<h4><span className=\"new\">NEW!</span> Special Relativity – For the Enthusiastic Beginner (David Morin)</h4>\n\t\t<ul className =\"nopoints\">\n\t\t<li>Self-published (so that I could keep the price low) through CreateSpace, 2017,</li><li>250 pages.</li>\n\t\t<li>Intended audience: College or advanced high school.</li>\n\t\t<li>Buy online (Amazon) Temporarily 50% off – see below.</li>\n\t\t<li>Paperback: $19.95</li>\n\t\t<li>Kindle eBook: $7.95 (or free if you buy the paperback from Amazon).
